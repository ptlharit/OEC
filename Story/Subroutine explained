You just made a SUBROUTINE call.
That is when you want to do something outside of your home. 
Once you get there, you want to do something, so you will do what you want to do. It can be more than one thing but at the end of the day, you will go back home. 

We'll show you some examples:
1. 	Nish goes to the mall
	Nish buys some toys
	Nish goes back home

2. 	Nish goes to school
	Nish learns programming
	Nish likes programming
	Nish goes home

3. 	Nish goes to the Park
	Nish plays on the slide
	Nish finds a ball
	Nish makes a new friend
	Nish goes back home
